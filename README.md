# Velirano

We want to help our president to keep track of all his promises. This app lists all promises made by our brand new president. At this very beginning, we just want to make sure that we do not forget anything and after 5 years, we want to celebrate all big changes, that our president promises us.

# A bit about the technical part

This page is written in react and deployed as github page so it is pure static. Which means that we need to update the data during 5 years in. That's ok, it is worth it :P it keeps us to follow the news.

# Where are the Promises listed?

> /src/component/data/velirano.js

Feel free to add more if we miss some.
The first list of promises were listed here [Madagascar Liberte](https://www.facebook.com/Madagascar-Liberte-323800257814589/?__xts__[0]=68.ARB30-118w_exr5aW8MnxPY6q0fFPvrnc2hiJLlJfXasisIQiBeWZej5U3Mr8mTBLL__yXs7f16iOq-TpKu67kpSLsbtsMBKKruDGCTOVAh5fvwMzK5VqDbtUIAs7QT3GtymEdSXxuGJYuNGXw39Pl-PG60yQQbzIo2gpxD-9pcOYRsQ3OwuGE8do4ubv_DwufqEB0E412hFiU9VFicIJp8o_xiAp3Is5_iyHe8Y8AP2yD5h_jiXjylBwu0C5rOpTUIvJ1PPjYu4knhLakt8zXlesCrf-0QphVqABSGLd2HCGRQF909b8IY0_Rg4XgjpU-o-EzDfMCD6CrkPW6BjXluzgA) We just copied it.
